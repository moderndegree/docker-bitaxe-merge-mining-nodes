# Bitcoin & DigiByte Node Configuration for Bitaxe Gamma Solo Mining
# ===================================================================
# Copy this file to .env and update with your actual values
# NEVER commit your .env file with real credentials to version control!
#
# This configuration is optimized for Bitaxe Gamma (~1.2 TH/s, ~20W)
# Based on BM1370 ASIC from Antminer S21 Pro

# Bitcoin Node Configuration
# ================================================================
# Use strong, unique credentials for security
# These will be used by your Bitaxe for solo mining connection
BTC_RPC_USER=your_btc_rpc_user
BTC_RPC_PASSWORD=your_secure_btc_password_here
BTC_RPC_PORT=8332
BTC_P2P_PORT=8333
# Set to 1 for testnet, 0 for mainnet
BTC_TESTNET=0

# DigiByte Node Configuration  
# ================================================================
# Use different credentials than Bitcoin for better security
# These will be used for merge mining DigiByte
DGB_RPC_USER=your_dgb_rpc_user
DGB_RPC_PASSWORD=your_secure_dgb_password_here
DGB_RPC_PORT=14022
DGB_P2P_PORT=12024
# Set to 1 for testnet, 0 for mainnet
DGB_TESTNET=0

# Network Configuration for Mining
# ================================================================
# Docker network settings - adjust for your Bitaxe network
NETWORK_SUBNET=172.20.0.0/16

# IMPORTANT: Configure this for your Bitaxe's network access
# Examples:
# - Same network as Docker host: 172.20.0.0/16 (default)
# - Local network access: 192.168.1.0/24
# - Specific Bitaxe IP: 192.168.1.100/32
# - Multiple networks: 172.20.0.0/16,192.168.1.0/24
RPC_ALLOW_IP=172.20.0.0/16

# Node Settings
# ================================================================
# Bitcoin: Conservative connection limit for stability
BTC_MAX_CONNECTIONS=125
# DigiByte: Higher limit as it handles more connections well
DGB_MAX_CONNECTIONS=300
# Transaction index: MUST be 1 for mining operations
TX_INDEX=1

# Mining Configuration Notes:
# ================================================================
# 
# Bitaxe Gamma Connection Settings:
# --------------------------------
# Hardware: BM1370 ASIC, ~1.2 TH/s, ~20W power consumption
# 
# Bitcoin Solo Mining:
#   Pool URL: stratum+tcp://YOUR_HOST_IP:8332
#   Worker: [value of BTC_RPC_USER above]
#   Password: [value of BTC_RPC_PASSWORD above]
#
# DigiByte Merge Mining:
#   Pool URL: stratum+tcp://YOUR_HOST_IP:14022  
#   Worker: [value of DGB_RPC_USER above]
#   Password: [value of DGB_RPC_PASSWORD above]
#
# Coinbase Wallet Integration:
# ================================
# To receive mining rewards directly in your Coinbase wallet:
# 
# 1. Get your Coinbase receive addresses:
#    - Bitcoin: Log into Coinbase > Portfolio > Bitcoin > Receive
#    - DigiByte: Note - Coinbase doesn't support DGB directly
#
# 2. Configure mining addresses (add these to your .env):
COINBASE_BTC_ADDRESS=your_coinbase_bitcoin_receive_address
# For DigiByte, you'll need a separate wallet (see DGB_PAYOUT_ADDRESS below)
DGB_PAYOUT_ADDRESS=your_digibyte_wallet_address

# Alternative Bitcoin Mining Address (optional)
# ===============================================
# If you want to use a different address than your Coinbase address for mining
# This could be useful for mining to a different wallet while keeping Coinbase for trading
BTC_MINING_ADDRESS=your_alternative_bitcoin_mining_address

# Important Notes for Coinbase Integration:
# ----------------------------------------
# - Coinbase DOES NOT support DigiByte (DGB)
# - You'll need a separate DGB wallet (Exodus, Trust Wallet, etc.)
# - Solo mining rewards go directly to specified addresses
# - Block rewards are substantial: ~6.25 BTC + fees per Bitcoin block
# - DigiByte rewards: varies by algorithm, typically much smaller
# - Consider the extremely low probability of finding blocks with 1.2 TH/s

#
# Power Supply Requirements:
# -------------------------
# - 5V DC, 25-30W rated power supply recommended
# - Meanwell GST60A05-P1J (30W) is excellent choice
# - 5.5x2.1mm center-positive barrel jack
# - Active cooling (40mm 5V fan) is REQUIRED
#
# Security Notes:
# ===============
# - Use passwords with at least 20 characters
# - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
# - Never reuse these passwords elsewhere
# - Consider using a password manager to generate secure passwords
# - Ensure your network allows Bitaxe to reach these ports
# - Monitor your mining activity and node synchronization regularly
